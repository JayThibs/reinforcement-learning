# Reinforcement Learning

Contains notes from reinforcement learning courses, books, and online guides.

## Reinforcement Learning is a concept of the same type as supervised and unsupervised learning. 

* In RL, there is no supervisor, only a reward signal (that was worth 3 points, that takes away 2 points, etc).  
* The feedback is delayed and not instantaneous. You might only see the effects of the reward signal further on.
* Time really matters in RL. We've got a dynamic system that depends on what the agent (ex: robot) sees at a given time since the next step will be correlated with the current step. The data is sequential.
* Agent's actions affect the subsequent data it receives. So if a robot is walking to one area of a room and then another area, both areas will give the robot different types of data. It's an active learning process that makes use of a combined set of differences that defines the RL paradigm.

## Examples of Reinforcement Learning

* Fly stunt manoeuvres in a helicopter
* Defeat the world champion at Backgammon Manage an investment portfolio
* Control a power station
* Make a humanoid robot walk
* Play many different Atari games better than humans
* Making a drone learn not to hit into things using computer vision to determine whether it is too close to a wall and needs to turn arround or it can continue moving in its current direction.
